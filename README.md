# library-hibernate-app

I created this on the 19/04/19 after a couple of weeks of trying to understand Spring and Hibernate.

After an interview for a Junior Java position I realised that I really needed to learn Hibernate and Spring, so I self taught myself Hibernate using a VARIETY of resources. It was difficult to find an updated version which worked for me at a level that I could understand, but despite how bare bones this program is, I'm extrememly proud of it, it's the furthest I've gone in my programming journey so far.
